                                <b>Convergence ratio (CR)</b>:  The CR is the ratio of the number of sequence pairs with edge alignment score values (derived
                                from BLAST e-values/bit scores) â‰¥ the minimum alignment score threshold used to generate the SSN to the total number
                                of sequence pairs.  The value of CR ranges from 1.0 for sequences that are very similar ("identical") to 0.0 for
                                sequences that are unrelated at the specified alignment score.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                At small values of the alignment score, the value of CR for a cluster can be ~ 1.0 even if the cluster is
                                heterofunctional (e-values are large; pairwise sequence similarity is small).  However, at larger values of the
                                alignment score, clusters with values approaching 1.0 are likely to be isofunctional (e-values are small; pairwise
                                sequence identity is large).  
                                </p>

                                Isofunctional clusters, as judged by shared genome context in the GNDs, often have CR values that approach 1.0.
                                However, the values of CR for isofunctional/orthologous clusters that contain sequences from phylogenetically diverse
                                species can decrease with increasing alignment score as the sequence divergence between orthologues in different
                                phylogenetic groups cause the CR to decrease.  In such situations, as the alignment score increases, an isofunctional
                                cluster with a low value for CR can segregate into smaller clusters for different phylogenetic groups with CR values
                                that approach 1.0.   Thus, values of CR that approach 1.0 are not required for isofunctionality; inspection of the
                                GNDs allows that assessment
                                </p>

                                <b>Conserved Cys Residues</b>:   A list is provided of the number of Conserved Cys Residues as a function of percent
                                conservation in the MSA.   Recall that, by definition, members of the RSS share a Cx3Cx2C motif for SAM-binding.
                                Conserved Cys residues in excess of 3 may be associated with additional FeS clusters, e.g., members of the SFLD
                                subgroup 17, SPASM/Twitch domain.
                                </p>

                                The sequences in the cluster are not edited prior to construction of the MSA, so some will be truncated (even if their
                                Sequence Status is "Complete").   Also, if the alignment score threshold is less than that required for
                                isofunctionality, the sequences in the MSA will be heterofunctional and, therefore, heterogeneous in length.
                                Therefore, the Number of Conserved Cys Residues can be expected to be a function of percent conservation, with the
                                most abundant conserved Cys motifs represented at large values of percent conservation and conserved Cys motifs in
                                less abundant sequences/functions represented at lower values of percent conservation.  Therefore, with the caveat
                                that the sequences in the cluster cannot be expected to be uniform in length, this summary can be used to evaluate
                                sequence and function heterogeneity.

                                The Conserved Cys Residues can/should be used together with the MSA, CR, length histograms, and GNDs in identifying

                                20%, and 10% conservation (column 2) are identified in columns 6 and greater. The number in column 3 is the number of
                                Cys residues conserved that percent conservation columns 4 and 5 provide the number of IDs in the cluster. The
                                canonical Cx3Cx2C is easily identified; additional conserved Cys residues may provide ligands to auxilliary Fe-S
