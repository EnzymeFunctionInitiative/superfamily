        The purpose of this website, https://radicalsam.org ("Site") is to
        provide "top-down" discovery of diverse enzyme functions in the radical
        SAM superfamily (RSS) using the  EFI’s (Enzyme Function Initiative)
        genomic enzymology web tools ("Tool"). The Tool aggregates and uses
        several third party data sources that are subject to their own terms of
        use services. The Site and its content is made available by the Board
        of Trustees of the University of Illinois ("Illinois", "we", "our",
        "us"), on behalf of the EFI at the Institute of Genomic Biology. The
        Site is owned by Illinois.
